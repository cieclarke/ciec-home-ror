                                    The website is using APIs from Flickr and Tumblr to manage the content.
                                    Using third party APIs for website content is a simple way to manage content in a website.
                                    The photos from Flickr are taken by me.
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    Developed with ReactJS on ASP.NET Core using TailwindCSS, the website displays the information from the external APIs.
                                    A systemctl service on rasbperry pi server regulary pulls the master branch from a GIT repository and runs this build and deploy.
